# Title
## Project Overview
We've been hired to process local election data; this requires reading a csv file to determine the total number of cast votes for each candidate, then exporting the results to a txt file. 

### Purpose
Using python this project reads an unpathed csv file, stores it's data in a list of dictionaries, counts and prints the results using for loops and if statements, then prints the results in the terminal and writes them to a text file.
